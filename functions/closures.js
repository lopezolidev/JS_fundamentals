/*
    Closure: A function that has access to its outer lexical scope

    lexical scope: Scope refers to the area where an item (such as a function or variable) is visible and accessible to other code. Lexical refers to the definition of variables, functions, etc. Lexical scope is the definition area of an expression. In other words the area where such expression was created.

    Understanding this definition, a "closure" means that a function can access to the outer spaces where variables, functions, and other expressions where defined, also with their own.

// here we can create a fixed adder with a specific value, then the closure brings the argument "x" we passed first and then invoking the inner function with "y" value we are fixating the first value to sum with any "y"

// increment_B "forgot" its lexical scope. When increment_A was defined, incrementer brought its lexical scope, therefore bringing also the memory within, that includes the value of count. Then, inc could increment count without redeclaring count for it to increment.

// instead, increment_B has no history of count variable. Then it's not the same lexical scope, even though it's the "same" variable. But in memory those (count from increment_A and count from increment_B) are totally different.

// this is not flexible

// can we alter a variable in a global scope using a closure?

const inc = incrementer()
// inc() ReferenceError: Cannot access 'count' before initialization
// this happens because the closure would be the global scope, which it could result in double pointers alteration to the same variable. Also because ' count ' is not defined in the same lexical scope of the function ' incr ', therefore it cannot find the variable
